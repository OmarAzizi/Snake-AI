This AI plays the snake game I made earlier. The learning technique I used is [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning), or in other words, Reward Learning, where the AI agent receives a penalty for doing something wrong and a reward for doing something right.

### Testing the AI Agent
This is a sped-up version for the agent playing the game, where the score in green is the current one, and the score in yellow is the highest achieved.


### Clone and Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmarAzizi/Snake-AI.git && cd Snake-AI
```

To build the and run the project
```bash
make && ./snake
```
